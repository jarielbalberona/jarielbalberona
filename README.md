# I build production systems. 🚀

Senior Fullstack Engineer focused on **system architecture**, **modern web platforms**, and **shipping maintainable code at scale**.  
I modernize legacy apps, design modular systems, and build end-to-end products across frontend, backend, and infrastructure.

**What I do best**
- Modernizing React/TypeScript codebases (architecture, tooling, performance, delivery velocity)
- Designing **feature-based**, modular frontend systems with strong DX and maintainability
- Building APIs and data flows with **Node.js + PostgreSQL**
- Production delivery: Docker, CI/CD, Infrastructure-as-Code, cloud patterns (AWS/Azure exposure)
